## Hey! ðŸ‘‹

I'm Oktawian, a 22 years old React Developer from Poland. Still learning and getting better ðŸ§ 

I have been interested in the IT industry for years, I develop myself as a programmer and this is what I associate my future with. I learn quickly, I am hungry for knowledge and it gives me a lot of pleasure. I graduated from a technical college with an IT profile in Poland. In my free time, I am passionate about fishing and regularly train soccer.
